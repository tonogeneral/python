And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. <br><br>And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.<br><br>Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose <b>\\\\n  <i>\\\\\\'voice is full of money\\\\\\'</i>\\\\n</b> - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of \\\\\\'high life\\\\\\' to win the heart of his own Southern belle.

Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. <br><br><b>And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.</b><blockquote>\\\\n  <i>\\\\\\'They were careless people, Tom and Daisy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\\\\\\'</i>\\\\n</blockquote><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380334544i/693803._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me a decade short of a hundred years since it was written.
